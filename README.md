# Machine-Learning
Objective & Data
The goal is to predict sale prices for homes in Chennai, Idia. Given a uncleaned dataset in csv format.

Task: Machine learning tasks are usually split into three categories; supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. In this, the task is supervised learning.

Supervised learning uses examples and labels to find patterns in data

It’s easy to recognise the type of machine learning task in front of you from the data you have and your objective. We’ve been given housing data consisting of features and labels, and we’re tasked with predicting the labels for houses.

Tools
I used Python and Google Colab. Colab are popular among data scientist because they are easy to follow, store, access and show your working steps.

Libraries: These are frameworks in python to handle commonly required tasks. I Implore any budding data scientists to familiarise themselves with these libraries:

Pandas — For handling structured data

Scikit Learn — For machine learning

NumPy — For linear algebra and mathematics

Matplotlib, Seaborn — For data visualization

Project Pipeline
Generally speaking, machine learning projects follow the same process. Data ingestion, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and finally machine learning.
